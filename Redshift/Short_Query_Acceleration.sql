*** Short Query Acceleration (SQA) in Redshift ***
Prioritizes short-running queries ahead of long-running queries.
Short-running queries get executed in a dedicated space.
Can reduce or get rid of WLM queues that are dedicated to running short queries.
CREATE TABLE AS and SELECT statements are eligible for SQA.
WLM by default dynamically assigns a value for the SQA maximum run time based on analysis of your cluster's workload. Alternatively, you can specify a fixed value of 1â€“20 seconds.
AWS recommends keeping the dynamic setting for SQA maximum run time.

-- To check whether SQA is enabled, run the following query.  If the query returns a row, then SQA is enabled.
SELECT  *

-- The following query shows the number of queries that went through each query queue (service class). 
-- It also shows the average execution time, the number of queries with wait time at the 90th percentile, 
-- and the average wait time. SQA queries use in service class 14.
